Public Comment: The public is encouraged to comment on agenda items at Commission meetings by completing a request-to-speak card (available from staff) and passing it to the Commission secretary. Public comment may be limited by any of the procedures set forth in Section 3.09 of MTC's Procedures Manual (Resolution No. 1058, Revised) if, in the chair's judgment, it is necessary to maintain the orderly flow of business.
